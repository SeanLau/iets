This is my first English artical about my thought.
I feel sick about censorship about Chinese Character.
I fear to express my hateness to CCP.
I know a mam in 2017, he got Nobel peace prizeï¼Œ and dead in jail. In the same year,
he was burnt to ashes, and even the ashes have to be thrown into the sea.
I was shocked by the news. A man dead even without anything left.
Why does the govement do that? Just because of the thought in his mind?
I can't understand that.
Chinese Character has a long history.They record ancient civilizations,but can't record the thought of a person? 
Some special articals even can't be broadcast on Internet.
It is ridiculous if the articals is truth,deleting will be  vile behavior; if the articals is fiction,Officials can claim they are lies
and point out the error.But they just delete them.
The only reason is the articals are truth,Officials fear them.
They fear the truth.
